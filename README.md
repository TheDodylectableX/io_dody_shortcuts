# io_dody_shortcuts
### A simple [Blender 3.X/4.X+](https://blender.org) plugin I've written to quickly do some functions while modding, saves a lot of clicks.

# Features
- Dedicated Sidebar menu to house all the features the plugin has
- Remove Vertex Groups, Modifiers, Vertex Colors and Shape Keys for all objects that have them *(Works in bulk)*
- A function to check how many shape keys an object has *(Currently works per single highlighted object - Open the System Console to check the count)*

# Installation Instructions
1. Grab the latest release from the Releases page or download the repository's code as a ZIP file.
2. Go to your Blender's Preferences menu > Add-ons > Install and Navigate to where you've downloaded said release/repo code archive then select it for install, Once done; tick it and you should be ready to go!
